# Introduction-to-Robotics

### Assignments done for UCSD CSE Intro to Robotics course under Prof. Henrik Christensen. 
### Languages: Python, ROS2

| Assignment | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **Assignment 1** | Implemented an open-loop control algorithm (i.e., without using a feedback loop to correct the robot) to navigate a robot through a series of ordered waypoints. This involved defining a kinematic model for the robot, calibrating its parameters, and designing a simple navigation strategy under open-loop conditions. |
| **Assignment 2** | Implemented a solution using the onboard camera to navigate the robot through a set of waypoints. By leveraging feedback from detected April Tag landmarks, improved localization performance enabled more effective driving. |
| **Assignment 3** | Implemented a version of the Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) technique and evaluated its performance. |
| **Assignment 4** | Implemented two path planning algorithms: one for maximum safety and one for minimum time/distance. |
| **Assignment 5** | Designed a Roomba-like system which navigates a map and provides full coverage. |
